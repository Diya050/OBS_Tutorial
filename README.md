## Open Broadcaster Software

Open Broadcaster Software (OBS Studio) is a powerful, free live streaming app (and screen recorder) compatible with all the major live stream platforms. It is completely free and open-source, and it has lots of useful features to help you produce professional live streams. OBS Studio also allows you to record your video, connect to any live streaming or video conferencing platform, and use any digital camera for live streaming.

## OBS Interface:

**Preview Area:** The area where we can view what is being recorded.

**Controls:** The box in the bottom right having "Start Streaming", "Start Recording", "Start Virtual Camera", "Studio Mode", "Settings" and "Exit" is the control panel of OBS.

**CPU Usage:** It shows CPU Usage information which tells us if our computer is under load or not to prevent bad live streams.

**Scene Transitions:** To the left of the Controls window, we have a panel for scene transitions that allows us to set what kind of scene transition effect will take place when we switch between scenes.OBS also provides additional built-in scene transition effects which we can add to the Scene Transitions drop-down list.

- Swipe
- Slide
- Stinger
- Fade to Color
- Luma Wipe

**Audio Mixer:** In the middle is the window that allows us to easily see and adjust our volume levels for each of the different elements or sources in our live stream.

**Sources:** Left of the Audio Mixer, we can add all of our webcams, images, videos, websites or any other sources into our live stream.

**Scenes:** In the bottom left corner is the Scenes panel.They are video canvases that are made up of one or more visual (and audio) elements from those sources. We can switch between various scenes.

## Settings:

### General Settings:
<br>

**General:** We can set language and theme for OBS studio. Also, "open stats dialogue on startup" option if enabled will allow us to view more information about CPU usage everytime we start OBS.

**Output:** Under the Output section we can also adjust these settings:

- Show confirmation dialogue when starting streams
- Show confirmation dialogue when stopping streams
- Show confirmation dialogue when stopping recording
- Automatically record when streaming

and many more to enhance our streaming.

**Source Alignment Snapping:** Source alignment snapping refers to the ability to automatically align sources (such as images, videos, or overlays) with each other or the canvas grid to create a more organized and precise layout.

**Projectors:** Individual sources, scenes, program, preview or the built-in OBS Multiview can be projected either in fullscreen or as a window.

**Multiview:** The OBS Studio Multiview feature is an ideal solution for live video production environments where a user wants to set up multiple scenes using multiple cameras as the sources.
