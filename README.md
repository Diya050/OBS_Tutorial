# Part - 1: Stream with OBS in 10 minutes
<br>

## Open Broadcaster Software

Open Broadcaster Software (OBS Studio) is a powerful, free live streaming app (and screen recorder) compatible with all the major live stream platforms. It is completely free and open-source, and it has lots of useful features to help you produce professional live streams. OBS Studio also allows you to record your video, connect to any live streaming or video conferencing platform, and use any digital camera for live streaming.

## OBS Interface:

**Preview Area:** The area where we can view what is being recorded.

**Controls:** The box in the bottom right having "Start Streaming", "Start Recording", "Start Virtual Camera", "Studio Mode", "Settings" and "Exit" is the control panel of OBS.

**CPU Usage:** It shows CPU Usage information which tells us if our computer is under load or not to prevent bad live streams.

**Scene Transitions:** To the left of the Controls window, we have a panel for scene transitions that allows us to set what kind of scene transition effect will take place when we switch between scenes.OBS also provides additional built-in scene transition effects which we can add to the Scene Transitions drop-down list.

- Swipe
- Slide
- Stinger
- Fade to Color
- Luma Wipe

**Audio Mixer:** In the middle is the window that allows us to easily see and adjust our volume levels for each of the different elements or sources in our live stream.

**Sources:** Left of the Audio Mixer, we can add all of our webcams, images, videos, websites or any other sources into our live stream.

**Scenes:** In the bottom left corner is the Scenes panel.They are video canvases that are made up of one or more visual (and audio) elements from those sources. We can switch between various scenes.

## Settings:

### General Settings:
<br>

**General:** We can set language and theme for OBS studio. Also, "open stats dialogue on startup" option if enabled will allow us to view more information about CPU usage everytime we start OBS.

**Output:** Under the Output section we can also adjust these settings:

- Show confirmation dialogue when starting streams
- Show confirmation dialogue when stopping streams
- Show confirmation dialogue when stopping recording
- Automatically record when streaming

and many more to enhance our streaming.

**Source Alignment Snapping:** Source alignment snapping refers to the ability to automatically align sources (such as images, videos, or overlays) with each other or the canvas grid to create a more organized and precise layout.

**Projectors:** Individual sources, scenes, program, preview or the built-in OBS Multiview can be projected either in fullscreen or as a window.

**Multiview:** The OBS Studio Multiview feature is an ideal solution for live video production environments where a user wants to set up multiple scenes using multiple cameras as the sources.

### Stream Settings:
<br>

This is where you can select which service you want to stream to. The primary ones you can select from are:

- Twitch
- YouTube
- Facebook Live
- Restream.io
- Twitter
- Show All… 

If you select Show All… you’ll see a comprehensive list of all the supported live streaming platforms. If we go for YouTube live stream, we nees streanm key or can also connect our account.

### Output Settings:

**Streaming Output Settings:** The two main settings you’ll want to adjust here are the video bitrate and audio bitrate.

**Video Bitrate:**
So when it comes to configuring your live stream, the default Video Bitrate is 4000 kilobits per second (kbps). To improve our live stream's video quality, increase the video bitrate, but ensure our internet speed can handle it.

**Audio Bitrate:**
We can also adjust the audio quality in the Audio Bitrate section. It is recommended to always stay above 128 here. 

The default is 160 which will give pretty good results. If the only audio in your live stream is our voice – this will be fine. If we require high quality audio such as for live streaming with music or using multiple audio tracks, we could set it anywhere from 192 right up to 320.

**Recording Output Settings:**
The OBS Screen Recorder is another awesome tool that we might want to adjust the settings for. Go to the Recording settings – here we can check the video recording quality and video recording format. We can also specify a recording path.
For recording quality, the options here are:

    Same as stream
    High Quality, Medium File Size
    Indistinguishable Quality, Large File Size
    Lossless Quality, Tremendously Large File Size

For recording format, .mp4 which is a universally recognized format is preferred.

With audio track (1-6), we can record 6 different audio tracks at a time (except in option "same as stream" for recording quality).


### Audio Settings:

Most of these settings will be fine to leave on the default, but there are a couple we might want to change.

**Channels:** Under General you can adjust the Channels setting. We’d recommend setting this to Stereo unless you specifically need to be broadcasting in Mono or 5.1 for example.
It depends on our personal preferences.

**Mic/Auxiliary Audio:** In the Audio tab under Global Audio Devices, we can adjust the Mic/Auxiliary Audio setting. This is our primary audio source. So change this from Default to whichever microphone we have connected.

Even if the default setting is using our correct microphone because of your System Settings, it is still strongly recommended manually setting it here just so we don’t have any issues down the track.

### Video Settings:

**Resolution:** Base (Canvas) Resolution refers to the resolution of the live stream in OBS. The default here is 1920 x 1080. Output (Scaled) Resolution refers to the resolution of the live stream that’s being broadcasted out to other platforms or even recorded. The default is 1280 x 720p.
Thus, the frame rate in OBS Studio doesn’t need to be the same frame rate we’re pushing out. Switch the Output (Scaled) Resolution to 1920 x 1080 to get high quality.

**Frame Rate:** You can adjust the frame rate by adjusting the setting called Common FPS Values.It defaults to 60 but we recommend setting it to 30. 60 FPS has a higher recording bitrate and takes up more storage. But if you want your viewers to experience no lag while watching gameplay videos and other high-quality content, this is the best option.

### Hotkeys Settings:

Hotkeys are keyboard shortcuts we can set up to control OBS Studio.

Some functions we can assign hotkeys to include:

- Start streaming
- Stop streaming
- Pause recording
- Split recording file
- Start virtual camera
- Show source toolbar
- Many more! 

This definitely isn’t necessary but it’s a great way to streamline our workflow so that we can control and configure everything really easily while we’re live streaming.

### Accessibility: 

This is a newer feature in OBS that helps people who may have a disability or eyesight issues.
You can select colors throughout the interface to better suit your needs.

### Advanced Settings:

- There are lots of advanced settings you can play around with in this section.
- One that we highly recommend selecting is Automatically Reconnect. This means if your internet connection drops out for any reason, OBS Studio will automatically attempt to reconnect and restart your stream.
- We can also specify names to be given to our recordings here.
- We can even set time for stream delay if required.

## Studio Mode:

When Studio mode is enabled, If you click a Scene, it will appear in the left window but won’t be visible to our viewers (essentially queuing it up). When we’re ready to bring that Scene on screen, press Transition and then our viewers will be able to see it.

To disable Studio Mode at any time, just click the Studio Mode button again in the Controls panel. In Studio Mode, we can easily switch between the different scenes we’ve set up. This is a more advanced feature.

## How to Use OBS Studio Scenes

As we mentioned earlier, Scenes are a useful feature that allow you to configure groups of assets or elements to use in your live stream. After creating a Scene, you can add assets & elements in the Source panel that you want to be assigned to that Scene.

We’ll run through how to create scenes, how to add sources and some examples of different Scenes you might like to create.

In the Scenes panel you’ll see there’s a default scene already created called Scene. This is because there always has to be at least one Scene.

You can rename it by right clicking and going to Rename. It’s a good idea to name this something that clearly tells you what the Scene is e.g. Main Camera.

## How To Add Sources In OBS

To adjust the source for the Scene, make sure the Scene is selected and press the + button in the Sources panel.

There are lots of different sources to choose from but say you wanted to add an extra video source, you would select Video Capture Device.

You can rename it, then you can select which video source you want to add by going to the Device drop down menu.

Under Preset you can choose from a range of options. We usually select High which is the highest quality option available (1920 x 1080p).

But as we mentioned, you’re not only limited to adding video sources. If you press the + button you could also select Image, for example. Then you can select an image from your computer, press Open and then Okay.

The image will appear full screen in your Preview Area. To turn that source on or off you can press the Eye icon beside that source.

## Examples Of Scenes In OBS Studio

Now let’s run through some examples of the different Scenes you might want to create.

### Creating A Presentation Scene

Let’s add a new Scene and call it Presentation.

With that Scene selected, go to the + button in the Source panel. We’re going to add three images to use as presentation slides. So we’ll select Image and upload those images to OBS one at a time.

`PRO TIP:` You can change the order of any Sources by clicking and dragging them.

Now at any time we click on the Presentation Scene to access those images/presentation. Or we can switch back to the main camera by clicking on the Main Camera Scene.

### OBS Studio Effects

There are ways to customize your video and audio even further.

Select your Scene and then select the video source you want to adjust in the Source panel.

Then hit the Filters button just below the Preview Area. A new window will appear.

## How To Crop Video Sources

Another tool you can access in the Filters section is Crop. Let’s say you wanted to crop the picture-in-picture that you added to your screen share earlier.

Select the relevant Scene and Source, then hit Filters. Under Effect Filters go to Crop/Pad and hit OK.

Then you can adjust the setting for Left, Right, Top and Bottom until you reach your optimal crop.
